    <h1> Christian Kumagai</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Christian Kumagai, a second-year Data Science student at UC San Diego with a background in competitive programming and a growing interest in machine learning. I’ve interned at places like Dexcom and will be heading to Amazon next summer. I enjoy building useful projects, learning new technologies, and staying curious about how things work.</p>
